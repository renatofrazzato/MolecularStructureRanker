# Molecular Structure Ranker
* Deep Learning model for molecular structure ranking based on pairwise learn to rank.
* The model was trained using QM7-x dataset.
# How to run it?
* You need a python enviroment with tensorflow.
* Download the files BatchDataFunctions.py and RankerModel.py then, run the jupyter notebook file.
* Keep the .py files in the same directory the jupyter notebook file you are running.
# Other information
* The training example files were trained using google colab GPU A100.
* QM7-X can be found in Hoja et al, or provided by reaching out the authors.
